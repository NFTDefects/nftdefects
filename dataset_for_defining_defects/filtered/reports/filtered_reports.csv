The hackers exchanged the funds for about 705 ETH on Uniswap. Audius officially stated that the problem has been found and is currently being repaired. All Audius smart contracts on Ethereum must be stopped, including tokens. The team believes that there is no further capital risk. Before the repair is completed, token balances, transfers, etc. will be temporarily unavailable. use.",,,,,

The main reason for this attack is that the burn function will call the callback function externally to cause the reentrancy problem, and the liquidation function uses the old vars value for judgment, resulting in the user's status identification even after reentrancy and then borrowing. Being set as unborrowed results in no repayments.",,,,,
2022/7/1,Quixotic,"220,000 OP",The buyer's purchase order is not checked,https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1542493260114931712,"Quiuixotic, the largest NFT platform in the Optimism ecosystem, has a serious vulnerability, and a large number of user assets have been stolen. Users who have traded on this market should cancel their authorization as soon as possible. According to SlowMist analysis, only the sell order is checked in the fillSellOrder function of the market contract, and the buyer's buy order is not checked. Therefore, the attacker first creates an arbitrary NFT contract, calls the fillSellOrder function to generate a sell order, and passes the buyer parameter as the victim's address and the paymentERC20 parameter as the token address to be stolen, then the user who is authorized to the market contract can be transferred. Tokens are transferred for profit.",,,,,

The core of this vulnerability is that when borrowing, there is no judgment on whether the NFT in the order has been withdrawn.",,,,,

The reason for this attack is that the unstake function of the pledge contract of the ownio project does not check the user's claim status, so the attacker can use the unstake function to receive the own tokens in the contract infinitely, thereby extracting all the own tokens in the pledge contract, and finally the attacker The acquired owned tokens are exchanged for 115 BNB through the pair transaction.",,,,,

According to SlowMist analysis, even if the problem of users' inability to refund is solved, due to the inconsistency between the number of bidders and the number of auctions and the defects of the project party's withdrawal function, Akutars funds will eventually be permanently locked.",,,,,
2022/3/17,APE,"$ 500,000",Airdrop Mechanism Vulnerability,https://twitter.com/wilburforce_/status/1504437189979119622,"According to a report by Twitter user Will Sheehan, the arbitrage bot took out more than 6w APE Coins (worth $8 each) through flash loans. After analysis, it was found that this was related to a loophole in the airdrop mechanism of APE Coin. Specifically, whether APE Coin can be airdropped depends on whether a user holds the instantaneous state of BYAC NFT, and this instantaneous state attacker can manipulate by borrowing a flash loan and then redeeming to obtain BYAC NFT. The attacker first borrows BYAC Token through flash loan, and then redeems to obtain BYAC NFT. Then use these NFTs to claim the airdropped APE, and finally use the BYAC NFT mint to obtain BYAC Token to return the flash loan.",,,,,

According to SlowMist analysis, the core of this vulnerability lies in the lack of judgment that the incoming _quantity parameter is not 0 before the ERC-721 standard NFT transfer, resulting in ERC -721 Standard NFT can be transferred directly and the cost of purchasing NFT is calculated as 0 when calculating the price. Hours after it was stolen, developers confirmed that hackers had begun returning stolen “Smol Brains” and other NFTs.",,,,,

The vulnerability appears to be related to the listing mechanism exploited by the platform and allows users to earn around 347 ETH by purchasing some NFTs at the previous listing price on different markets.,,,,,
2022/1/17,Crypto Burger,"$ 770,000",Contract vulnerabilities,https://web3isgoinggreat.com/single/cryptoburgers-hacked,"There is a vulnerability in the Crypto Burger project, an NFT project on the BSC chain. ""The attacker discovered a vulnerability related to the $BURG token contract, which managed to burn most of the tokens in the liquidity pool, while immediately liquidating the tokens it had previously acquired, from liquidity,"" the project said in a statement. $770,000 was stolen from the pool.”",,,,,
2021/9/10,OpenSea,"$ 100,000",System vulnerabilities,http://chainb.com/?P=Cont&id=32317,"A vulnerability in NFT marketplace OpenSea resulted in at least 42 NFTs being sent to a burn address, worth at least $100,000. The issue was first raised by Nick Johnson, lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), who noted that when he transferred an ENS domain name (in the form of an NFT), it was transferred to a burn address. This means it was accidentally sent to an uncontrolled address and can no longer be moved. Regarding the destroyed ENS domain name, Johnson said it was the first registered ENS domain name, called rilxxlir.eth, which was held by an ENS account when Johnson registered it with personal funds. In order to transfer the ENS domain name to his own account, he went to OpenSea to perform the transfer, only to find that it had been sent to a destruction address by mistake. Since Johnson is still the controller of the ENS domain name, he can still make changes, just cannot move the domain name. Johnson then received further reports from others who were similarly affected and compiled a list of 32 affected transactions involving 42 NFTs. Most NFTs use the ERC-721 standard, but a few use ERC-1155. He looked at the floor price of each NFT, which totaled about $100,000. Johnson claims that OpenSea has now fixed the vulnerability.",,,,,
